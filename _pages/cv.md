Research Experience
======
**University of Virginia / Pennsylvania State University**
*Research Assistant (Advisor: Prof. Jing Yang)*
*Sep. 2021 - Present*
* **In-Context Learning & Optimization:** Proved that unlabeled data enhances ICL performance and developed a framework where Transformers emulate iterative refinement (CoT). Demonstrated that Transformers can implement LISTA-type learning-to-optimize algorithms for sparse recovery.
* **Personalized RLHF:** Proposed a framework using shared Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to capture user-specific preferences while reducing sample complexity.
* **Federated Learning:** Developed algorithms for Federated Representation Learning in under-parameterized regimes and exploited feature heterogeneity to improve generalization.

**University of Pennsylvania**
*Research Assistant (Advisor: Prof. Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti)*
*Aug. 2019 - May 2021*
* **Information Theory:** Investigated Age of Information (AoI) and rate tradeoffs in broadcast channels.
* Developed simulation scripts to analyze coding policies.
