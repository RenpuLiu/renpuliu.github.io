I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at the University of Virginia, advised by [Prof. Jing Yang](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/jing-yang). Prior to joining UVA, I began my Ph.D. studies at Pennsylvania State University. I received my Master's degree from the University of Pennsylvania and my Bachelor's degree from Nanjing University.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs), Reinforcement Learning, and Distributed Optimization. 


My recent research has been accepted to top-tier conferences including NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, and AISTATS.
